GitReaper is a helper script written in Ruby that is run in an existing terminal.

It will run on a loop, adding and committing to git. Upon commit, it includes a commit message based on most recent file modified in the directory for which GitReaper is in.

How to use?

-Make sure Ruby is installed.
-Navigate to a directory or subdirectory and put gitreaper.rb inside.
-run the script with: "ruby gitreaper.rb"
-make changes to a file
-hit enter to terminate the program and to push all commits to whatever branch your git is tracking.

This program is still being developed - it may get better.
